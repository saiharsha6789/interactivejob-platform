# Interactive Job and internship platform for technical education department
This project presents a comprehensive job portal system developed comprising modules for Admin, Jobseeker/Student, and Recruiter/Company. The Admin module allows the administrator to manage the portal effectively by viewing registered users, companies, and job postings, and logging out. The User module enables job seekers and students to register, log in, search for jobs based on their skills, receive recommendations, apply for jobs, participate in live or virtual exams, and track the status of their applications. The Recruiter module is designed for companies to register, log in, add job requirements, and create exams (MCQs) for applicants, and view user profiles and exam details. Recruiters can select or reject candidates based on exam performance and other criteria. The project aims to provide a seamless job application and recruitment experience, integrating key functionalities like job recommendations, online exams, and application status tracking, ensuring an efficient and user-friendly platform for both job seekers and recruiters.
